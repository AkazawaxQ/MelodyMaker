Mini pianos provide significant benefits for educational purposes. They can be used as teaching 
materials in schools, educational centers, or hobby workshops, offering students the 
opportunity to practice and making learning enjoyable. Additionally, making a mini piano is 
highly valuable for music education. It serves as an excellent tool for learning music notes and 
frequencies, enhancing musical perception and rhythm sense. While experiencing the 
satisfaction of creating a musical instrument with your own hands, you can unleash your 
creativity by composing different melodies. In this project where electronics and music 
converge, it's possible to explore new sounds and tones. Mini pianos, regarded as both 
entertaining and instructive activities at home, enable family members or friends to engage in 
music-related group activities. You can compose and play your own tunes and share this 
process with your loved ones.
